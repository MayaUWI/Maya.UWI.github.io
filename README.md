**Software Engineering II- Journal**

### 26th September 2018
**First group meeting**
* The team agreed on meeting time, decided who would be Scrum Master and Project owner and fleshed out ideas.
* Michael pitched the idea to one potential end user, and they gave feedback. Thus we decided to gain requirements through student questionnaires and interviews.
* Online meeting scheduled for tomorrow (Thursday) night, to discuss second milestone and further plans of action.

### 27th September 2018
**First online group meeting**
* The group started the questionnaire process; figuring out what questions to ask.
* Did research on already existing applications like ours.
* Questionnaire planning was given 2 days with the public release on Monday and data review Tuesday evening.
* Meeting on Saturday to discuss questionnaire questions.

### 29th September 2018
**Second online group meeting**
* Did not participate in group call due to weak connection, however stayed vigilant on links and partial conversations shared in chat
* The group created the questionnaire, everyone contributed to the questions and edits were made
* The questionnaire is on Google forms and the link will be shared in various UWI chat groups
* Questionnaire sent to Lecturer for advice/critique

### 30th September 2018  
**Research and Self-improvement**
				 
* Reading up on the platforms and technologies discussed by group. Currently have 0 knowledge in Django, plan to attempt small projects to familiarize self
* Break Down of weekday
	* Read up about Django, check documentation
	* Attempt a basic hello world, basic input, output and calculations
	* Try design and layout editing with Django (research if its even a thing)*
	* Talk to group about other features of app to add to practice
	* See how much I can do from ground zero in 4 hours
* Break Down of Weekend 
	* Refresh memory on Firebase
	* Attempt a basic connection to dummy application
	* Plan out potential database schema, and discuss with group

* EDIT: Nope, just a framework, can use templates or create own using HTML,CSS etc. So 'deign and Layout planning while implementation Django'.
				 
### 1st October 2018  
**Research and Self-improvement and other activities- Update 1**

* Read up Django documentation, updated python and pip. 
* Set up environment for windows. 
* Did a tutorial on how to set up and display hello world with django. 
* Had multiple errors and setbacks (folder mix up and wrong path or name given). 
* Kept getting weird syntax error, scrapped app and project, kept virtual environment and retried the steps. 
* Learned tutorial was catering for 1.x.x version and the 2.x.x changed formats (path vs url) found new [tutorial](https://www.codementor.io/kratos/building-an-hello-world-application-with-python-django-95sysyr6v)
* Merged new tutorials together.The [first tutorial](https://djangobook.com/installing-django/) explained why and*what to watch out for but ended up googling what they meant out of confusion in some parts.And second mentioned in point before, helped with the displaying "Hello,world". However need to review it to understand the process more. 
* Completed 1st task and 1/5 of second.

### 20th October 2018  
**ToDo's**
				 
* Modify schema for SQLite include table for GPA that will hold CurrentGpa,CumulativeGPA and TargetGPA. Will not hold any foreign keys but will have relations to the Semester table 
* Will not link new GPA table to Years table as that can be calculated by application  _(YearGPA= SUM(select semester.CurrentGPa as results where ....)/count(results))_  something like that...  
* Decide whether to make a general adapter that handles all table creation,deletion and update with the same functions. or create separate functions for all 7 tables (... probably not the latter)

* Links to tutorials were shared in discord chat 
* Discussed on what next week task are (Testing) and what methods are we going to use (Firebase? Android robolectric? Junit? espresso? All of the above?) 
* Testing previously was hard as the group focused on developing incrementally on class relations than product blocks.  But joint group decision of next sprint being fully modular in terms of developing in mini deployable tasks  
* The users from the one-on-one and interviews will be used for User testing after Circle CI and Application test cases are implemented

![Tutorial Links](image/disc2.PNG)

### 8th November 2018
**Before sprint meeting**
* Group agreed to 3rd meeting date: Saturday and 9pm.
* Azel will be the next Scrum master.
* Michael will remain as the product owner.
* Testing will be done saturday, user testing within the week (Tuesday hopefully)
* Team discussed [2nd backlog](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11622hB5bmtMfLWnfNbIh-5QDW3icIt4tWNJm4WFN3Fc/edit)
* New Scrum board on [Scrumy](https://scrumy.com/sweproject_sprint2) 

### 12th November 2018
**Sprint meeting**
* BurnDown chart created by new SCRUM master Azel 
![Burn-Down Chart](image/bdc2.PNG)
* Sprints starts today.
* Progress maybe slow as we have upcoming courseworks and assignments.
* Azel is uploading the app to googleplay
* Michael is hesitant to do the user testing, he want to brainstorm how we release this to the users and how testing is done. I think the app should be released and see how it survies in the wild (since that will really tell us if the app is great or not). Amanda is worried about the time constraints... Christopher just wants to get it done... Azel is trying to be the peace keeper.
* I mentioned the ability to use Google user download count and anyother information Google provides. Users can also rate the app and give feedback in comments.Also, to release the app as a beta since we expext unexpected bugs/errors and the emails sent to users who agreed in the survey can hold a link to the Playstore.
* Michael is the Project Owner, incharge of interaction with the users. He proposes a Google Feedback form and gave examples of what the form could entail. 
* To end the debate, Christopher and Amanda offered to create the Google feed back form.

* My Tasks: 
	* Testing:
		* [ ] Creating User Class
		* [ ] Cumulative GPA Calculation
		* [ ] Edit Profile Data
		* [ ] Update Semester GPA Reflective of Course
		
Will start after Math CW and Assignments.
		
### 15th November 2018
**Meeting and Sprint**

**Meeting**
* Talked about Circle CI
* Azel invited us into his CI team
* Michael had problems with his Android studio. His run configurations were... non existent. I worked with him to add back the configurations and the problem was solved.

**Sprint**
* Everyone talked about what they did for the sprint so far.
* Amanda created a card that will be sent to our users. 
![User App info Card](image/user.png)
* I reported that I started my [scrumy](https://scrumy.com/sweproject_sprint2) board tasks. Also, I shared a few tutorials and cleared up any misconceptions (Test vs androidTest).


### 17 November 2018
**Sprint**
* Christopher reported that he began his tasks and it can be pulled. He also found a floating variable that should have been assigned while writing tests.
* Micheal is stil confused as to how testing works and after a breif explination and suggestion to watch everyones code, he seemed a little less hesitant.
* Azel stated that he fixed a few bugs he found upon user testing.
* Amanda, had issues with a few of the classes containing calcuations, but they were resolved after Azel repairs.
* I have not done anything other than the two taks on the scrumy board and will continue on Tuesday.

* We also shared things we learned. (pressing ctrl+shift+t, to creat a new test, other testing methods other than JUnit4, and understanding how Circle CI uses the tests we have writen).

* My Tasks: 
	* Testing:
		* [ ] Creating User Class- Haitus( used a tutorial )
		* [ ] Cumulative GPA Calculation- Inprogress
		* [ ] Edit Profile Data- Inprogress
		* [ ] Update Semester GPA Reflective of Course


### 19th November 2018
* should fix the overflow problem in the jounal side overview panel.
**Sprint Meeting**
* Meeting was rescheduled for 7pm.
* Amanda reported that she found n error in the date class and made the corrections.
* Circle ci have set up configuration problems so that needs to be fixed.
* Christopher said that he has not done anything since Saturday.
* Micheal said he completed a task and will continue to tackle the others.
* I have not done anything else task wise. Looking up the errors given by Circle CI and will share with Azel what I've found.

### 21st November 2018
**Sprint Day 6**

* What I did in this sprint so far:
	* Edit Circle CI confi files. Fix errors detected by Cirlce CI, status now from fail to Successful.
	* Continue writing testing for the task assigned to me.
	
* Tutorials used left me a bit confused. But I learned that the reason the cache could not be restored and saved,gradle and tests not found   is because we did not have our application file as the main files in our SWE repo. Thus, a "reroute" had to be done (told CI to look into a blank folder and feed the files needed into it). I am still a bit confused about CI, but willing to learn more about it.
* Amanda expressed worry about doing Junit testing with firebase. I found mockito framework, and decided to do some reseach on it to see if it solves our problems (Will also ask sir for recommendations in class tomorrow).

* My Tasks: 
	* Testing:
		* [x] Creating User Class
		* [ ] Cumulative GPA Calculation- Inprogress
		* [ ] Edit Profile Data- Inprogress
		* [ ] Update Semester GPA Reflective of Course- Inprogress

### 22nd November 2018	
**Srpint**
* Amanda explained conversation with lecturer about our Firebase issue
* Michael is having internet issues and will not be joining us
* Azel wished to extend sprint to Monday
* Waiting for User Feedback from Version 1.0(1.0 since 1st sprint on our error was multiple increments)
* Learning from our errors. next increment will be version 1.3( 1.3 because we first fixed errors and bugs in code(1.2), then added the predictive grade features (1.3))
* We will try to fix the firebase issue tonight.

### 23rd November 2018
**Sprint Updates**
* Managed to work around firebase. Shared with team and now waiting for feedback to see if it worked for them also.
* Recommended that we record our next meeting to include in our journals.
* My Tasks: 
	* Testing:
		* [x] Creating User Class
		* [ ] Cumulative GPA Calculation- Inprogress
		* [x] Edit Profile Data
		* [ ] Update Semester GPA Reflective of Course- Inprogress

**Worries**
* "Proper" Testing will not be possible due to how our code is structured. What could have been done was the functions that perform tasks can return hashmaps to a Firebase function related to that funtions task. Example in UserController, the method updateYearForUser();

~~~
    public static void updateYearForUser(final User user, Year year, final FirebaseDatabaseHelper.Closable closable){
        if(year != null) {
            DatabaseReference myRef = FirebaseDatabaseHelper.getFirebaseDatabaseInstance().getReference();

            HashMap<String, Object> updates = new HashMap<>();

            updates.put(year.getYearId(), year);

            myRef.child("years").updateChildren(updates).addOnCompleteListener(new OnCompleteListener<Void>() {
                @Override
                public void onComplete(@NonNull Task<Void> task) {
                    closable.close(user);
                }
            });
        }
    }
~~~

What could have been done instead :
1. updateYearForUser handles only getting the changed values from user
~~~
    public static HashMap updateYearForUser(final User user, Year year){
        if(year != null) {
            HashMap<String, Object> updates = new HashMap<>();

            updates.put(year.getYearId(), year);
            
        return  updates;
    }
~~~
2. UpdateYearFirebase uses the Hashmap from updateYearForUser();

~~~
/*
//In the class EditYear, in function save()
//HashMap k =  updateYearForUser(user,year);
//UpdateYearFirebase(k,this);
*/
public void UpdateYearFirebase(HashMap updates,final  final FirebaseDatabaseHelper.Closable closable){
	if(!updates.ismpty()){
		DatabaseReference myRef = FirebaseDatabaseHelper.getFirebaseDatabaseInstance().getReference();
		myRef.child("years").updateChildren(updates).addOnCompleteListener(new OnCompleteListener<Void>() {
                @Override
                public void onComplete(@NonNull Task<Void> task) {
                    closable.close(user);
                }
            });
	}
}
~~~
* I will see if its possible to fix all the classes with these problems... Time however is very limited.

* I Informed group that testing is a sign of a complete increment and that I could not find any reading that stated that testing was within sprint tasks. I did find that they are 'tasks' that should have been done throughout the sprint in parallel with development. Live and learn I guess. Testing for 2nd increment will be done in parallel (Hopefully).
