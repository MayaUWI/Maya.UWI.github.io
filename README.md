**Software Engineering II- Journal**

### 26th September 2018
**First group meeting**
* The team agreed on meeting time, decided who would be Scrum Master and Project owner and fleshed out ideas.
* Michael pitched the idea to one potential end user, and they gave feedback. Thus, we decided to gain requirements through student questionnaires and interviews.
* Online meeting scheduled for tomorrow (Thursday) night, to discuss second milestone and further plans of action.

### 27th September 2018
**First online group meeting**
* The group started the questionnaire process; figuring out what questions to ask.
* Did research on already existing applications like ours.
* Questionnaire planning was given 2 days with the public release on Monday and data review Tuesday evening.
* Meeting on Saturday to discuss questionnaire questions.

### 29th September 2018
**Second online group meeting**
* Did not participate in group call due to weak connection, however stayed vigilant on links and partial conversations shared in chat
* The group created the questionnaire, everyone contributed to the questions and edits were made
* The questionnaire is on Google forms and the link will be shared in various UWI chat groups
* Questionnaire sent to Lecturer for advice/critique

### 30th September 2018  
**Research and Self-improvement**
				 
* Reading up on the platforms and technologies discussed by group. Currently have 0 knowledge in Django, plan to attempt small projects to familiarize self
* Break Down of weekday
	* Read up about Django, check documentation
	* Attempt a basic hello world, basic input, output and calculations
	* Try design and layout editing with Django (research if it’s even a thing)*
	* Talk to group about other features of app to add to practice
	* See how much I can do from ground zero in 4 hours
* Break Down of Weekend 
	* Refresh memory on Firebase
	* Attempt a basic connection to dummy application
	* Plan out potential database schema, and discuss with group

* EDIT: Nope, just a framework, can use templates or create own using HTML, CSS etc. So 'design and Layout planning while implementation Django'.
				 
### 1st October 2018  
**Research and Self-improvement and other activities- Update 1**

* Read up Django documentation, updated python and pip. 
* Set up environment for windows. 
* Did a tutorial on how to set up and display hello world with Django. 
* Had multiple errors and setbacks (folder mix up and wrong path or name given). 
* Kept getting weird syntax error, scrapped app and project, kept virtual environment and retried the steps. 
* Learned tutorial was catering for 1.x.x version and the 2.x.x changed formats (path vs URL) found new [tutorial](https://www.codementor.io/kratos/building-an-hello-world-application-with-python-django-95sysyr6v)
* Merged new tutorials together. The [first tutorial](https://djangobook.com/installing-django/) explained why and*what to watch out for but ended up googling what they meant out of confusion in some parts. And second mentioned in point before, helped with the displaying "Hello, world". However, need to review it to understand the process more. 
* Completed 1st task and 1/5 of second.

	   * Do you keep track of your GPA during the semester? 
	   * How do you calculate your GPA? 
	2. Post Application explanation
	   * Would you use this app? 
	   * if no, why? 
	3. Explain already planned features
	   * What are your feelings about the app now? 
	   * What features are your favourite? What should be changed? Do you have any other features in mind?

**ToDo's**
				 
* Modify schema for SQLite include table for GPA that will hold CurrentGpa, CumulativeGPA and TargetGPA. Will not hold any foreign keys but will have relations to the Semester table 
* Will not link new GPA table to Years table as that can be calculated by application  _(YearGPA= SUM(select semester.CurrentGPa as results where ....)/count(results))_  something like that...  
* Decide whether to make a general adapter that handles all table creation, deletion and update with the same functions. or create separate functions for all 7 tables (... probably not the latter)

### 1st November 2018  
**Testing (unit, UI, etc and User) **

* Links to tutorials were shared in discord chat 
* Discussed on what next week task is (Test Cases) and what methods are we going to use (Firebase? Android robolectric? Junit? espresso? All the above?) 
* Testing previously was hard as the group focused on developing incrementally on class relations than product blocks.  But joint group decision of next sprint being fully modular in terms of developing in mini deployable tasks  
* The users from the one-on-one and interviews will be used for User testing after Circle CI and Application test cases are implemented 
* Switching of roles Product-Owner and SCRUM Master will be decided in meeting before second sprint.

![Tutorial Links](image/disc2.PNG)

### 8th November 2018
**Before sprint meeting**
* Group agreed to 3rd meeting date: Saturday and 9pm.
* Azel will be the next Scrum master.
* Michael will remain as the product owner.
* Testing will be done Saturday, user testing within the week (Tuesday hopefully)
* Team discussed [2nd backlog](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11622hB5bmtMfLWnfNbIh-5QDW3icIt4tWNJm4WFN3Fc/edit)
* New Scrum board on [Scrumy](https://scrumy.com/sweproject_sprint2) 

### 12th November 2018
**Sprint meeting**
* Burndown chart created by new SCRUM master Azel 
![Burn-Down Chart](image/bdc2.PNG)
* Sprints starts today.
* Progress maybe slow as we have upcoming coursework and assignments.
* Azel is uploading the app to Google play
* Michael is hesitant to do the user testing, he wants to brainstorm how we release this to the users and how testing is done. I think the app should be released and see how it survives in the wild (since that will really tell us if the app is great or not). Amanda is worried about the time constraints... Christopher just wants to get it done... Azel is trying to be the peace keeper.
* I mentioned the ability to use Google user download count and any other information Google provides. Users can also rate the app and give feedback in comments. Also, to release the app as a beta since we expect unexpected bugs/errors and the emails sent to users who agreed in the survey can hold a link to the Playstore.
* Michael is the Project Owner, in charge of interaction with the users. He proposes a Google Feedback form and gave examples of what the form could entail. 
* To end the debate, Christopher and Amanda offered to create the Google feedback form.

* My Tasks: 
	* Testing:
		* [ ] Creating User Class
		* [ ] Cumulative GPA Calculation
		* [ ] Edit Profile Data
		* [ ] Update Semester GPA Reflective of Course
		
Will start after Math CW and Assignments.
		
### 15th November 2018
**Meeting and Sprint**

**Meeting**
* Talked about Circle CI
* Azel invited us into his CI team
* Michael had problems with his Android studio. His run configurations were... non-existent. I worked with him to add back the configurations and the problem was solved.

**Sprint**
* Everyone talked about what they did for the sprint so far.
* Amanda created a card that will be sent to our users. 
![User App info Card](image/user.png)
* I reported that I started my [scrumy](https://scrumy.com/sweproject_sprint2) board tasks. Also, I shared a few tutorials and cleared up any misconceptions (Test vs androidTest).


### 17 November 2018
**Sprint**
* Christopher reported that he began his tasks and it can be pulled. He also found a floating variable that should have been assigned while writing tests.
* Michael is still confused as to how testing works and after a brief explanation and suggestion to watch everyone’s code, he seemed a little less hesitant.
* Azel stated that he fixed a few bugs he found upon user testing.
* Amanda had issues with a few of the classes containing calculations, but they were resolved after Azel repairs.
* I have not done anything other than the two takes on the scrumy board and will continue Tuesday.

* We also shared things we learned. (pressing ctrl+shift+t, to create a new test, other testing methods other than JUnit4, and understanding how Circle CI uses the tests we have written).

* My Tasks: 
	* Testing:
		* [ ] Creating User Class- Hiatus( used a tutorial )
		* [ ] Cumulative GPA Calculation- InProgress
		* [ ] Edit Profile Data- InProgress
		* [ ] Update Semester GPA Reflective of Course


### 19th November 2018
* should fix the overflow problem in the journal side overview panel.
**Sprint Meeting**
* Meeting was rescheduled for 7pm.
* Amanda reported that she found an error in the date class and made the corrections.
* Circle ci have set up configuration problems so that needs to be fixed.
* Christopher said that he has not done anything since Saturday.
* Michael said he completed a task and will continue to tackle the others.
* I have not done anything else task wise. Looking up the errors given by Circle CI and will share with Azel what I've found.

### 21st November 2018
**Sprint Day 6**

* What I did in this sprint so far:
	* Edit Circle CI config files. Fix errors detected by Circle CI, status now from fail to Successful.
	* Continue writing testing for the task assigned to me.
	
* Tutorials used left me a bit confused. But I learned that the reason the cache could not be restored and saved, gradle and tests not found   is because we did not have our application file as the main files in our SWE repo. Thus, a "reroute" had to be done (told CI to look into a blank folder and feed the files needed into it). I am still a bit confused about CI, but willing to learn more about it.
* Amanda expressed worry about doing Junit testing with firebase. I found Mockito framework, and decided to do some research on it to see if it solves our problems (Will also ask sir for recommendations in class tomorrow).

* My Tasks: 
	* Testing:
		* [x] Creating User Class
		* [ ] Cumulative GPA Calculation- Inprogress
		* [ ] Edit Profile Data- Inprogress
		* [ ] Update Semester GPA Reflective of Course- Inprogress

### 22nd November 2018	
**Srpint**
* Amanda explained conversation with lecturer about our Firebase issue
* Michael is having internet issues and will not be joining us
* Azel wished to extend sprint to Monday
* Waiting for User Feedback from Version 1.0(1.0 since 1st sprint on our error was multiple increments)
* Learning from our errors. next increment will be version 1.3(1.3 because we first fixed errors and bugs in code(1.2), then added the predictive grade features (1.3))
* We will try to fix the firebase issue tonight.

### 23rd November 2018
**Sprint Updates**
* Managed to work around firebase. Shared with team and now waiting for feedback to see if it worked for them also.
* Recommended that we record our next meeting to include in our journals.
* My Tasks: 
	* Testing:
		* [x] Creating User Class
		* [ ] Cumulative GPA Calculation- Inprogress
		* [x] Edit Profile Data
		* [ ] Update Semester GPA Reflective of Course- Inprogress

**Worries**

* I Informed group that testing is a sign of a complete increment and that I could not find any reading that stated that testing was within sprint tasks. I did find that they are 'tasks' that should have been done throughout the sprint in parallel with development. Live and learn I guess. Testing for 2nd increment will be done in parallel (Hopefully).


### 24 November 2018
**Sprint meeting**
* [Meeting recording](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12Xu111u5PXLLtnOyBGqga2tbVlteoMw0)
* Was reported that our google log in was not working. I informed the group that it was because we weren’t using the new google assigned SHA1 key on 'app release'.
* Everyone talked about the stand still with the firebase problem
* was discussed that that will be fixed by tomorrow.
* Michael reported that the emails sent out went to Junk. (This was most likely since the newly created email was used to send it. Emails with low inbox count and max send outs tend to be filtered out/placed in junk)
* Michael will resend the invite cards using his email.
* Sending app link and feedback form to my Hall, will try to get pictures of them utilizing the app, recording too if they feel generous.

###26 Novemeber 2018
**Sprint day 12**
**CI battle - _Circle CI errors after a successful run in Android studio_**

![Circle CI errors after a successful run in Android studio](image/fun4.jpg)

* Circle CI is...interesting. The current build is throwing a Null Pointer Exception in four classes SemesterGPACalculationTest.java, SemesterController.java, UserController.java and UserControllerTest.
* For SemesterGPACalculationTest, the reason is the __Semester semester;__ statement.
~~~
public class SemesterGPACalculationTest {
    private swe2slayers.gpacalculationapplication.models.User user;
    Year originalYear;
    Semester semester;
    Course course1, course2, course3, course4;
    private static boolean alreadySetUp = false;

~~~
* The object is Null and is assigned values in _@Before_. however, a local object referencing the global object is needed.
~~~
semester = new Semester("Semester 1", originalYear.getYearId(), originalYear.getUserId());
semester.setSemesterId("tempsemester1");
....
UserController.addSemesterForUser(user, semester, null);	
~~~
* However the object is still seen as null to circle CI. Thus the statement
![CI Error](image/CIbug1.PNG)

* Same issue occurred in UserControllerTest.java (My task).
* Circle CI reported a Null Pointer Exception. The problem was the variable assigned in the is equal function in Course.java. __edit: No that was not the problem__
* I... made an error changing the a variable for no reason since I did not trace through properly :no_good: The only classes with problems are the Test ones. 
~~~
@Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
       // return this.getCourseId().equals(((Course)obj).getCourseId());//was 100% fine
        return this.userId.equals(((Course)obj).getCourseId());//my error
    }
~~~

* OK! After the 5th regroup and push, UserControllerTest was fixed by creating a User object use that references the global object(user) and
add the reference object where needed.
~~~
 public void updateCourseForUser() {
        ...
        User use=user;
        Course c= new Course("Comp 3613","Software Engineering 2",s.getSemesterId(),user.getUserId(),3,3,85);
        c.setCourseId("1weqweqwe");
        UserController.addCourseForUser(use,c,null);
        ...
        UserController.updateCourseForUser(use,c,null);
    }
~~~
* The same with SemesterGPACalculationTest, create Semester object referencing global object and class objects do the same also.
and Yay, build successful. :coffee: Moral of the story don't look at code when tired at 4:37 Am.
* Will discuss issues with SemesterGPACalculationTest with Christopher (since it is his task).

**Update 5:14**
* Circle CI throws error on the same thing it just said successful on in previous push!
* 5:15: push again, successful again... :neutral_face:
* could the problem be on the configurations done?
